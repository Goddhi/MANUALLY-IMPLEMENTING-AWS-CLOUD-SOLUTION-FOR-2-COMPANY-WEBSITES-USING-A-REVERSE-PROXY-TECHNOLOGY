## Introduction

In this project, you will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company (Choose an interesting name for it) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website for their DevOps team. As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

### Starting Off Your AWS Cloud Project

There are few requirements that must be met before you begin:

1. Properly configure your AWS account and Organization Unit [Watch How To Do This Here](https://youtu.be/9PQYCc_20-Q)

- Create an AWS Master account. (Also known as Root Account).
- Within the Root account, create a sub-account and name it DevOps. (You will need another email address to complete this)

Note: For a newly created account you might need to configure AWS service quota to allow you to create more accounts on the root account. [Read how to do this here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/organizations-account-exceeded/#:~:text=Resolution,Line%20Interface%20(AWS%20CLI).)

- Within the Root account, create an AWS Organization Unit (OU). Name it Dev. (We will launch Dev resources in there)

- Move the DevOps account into the Dev OU.
- Login to the newly created AWS account using the new email address.

2. Create a free domain name for your fictitious company at Freenom domain registrar [here](https://www.freenom.com/).

Create a hosted zone in AWS, and map it to your free domain from Freenom. This gives a guide on how to do this

### SET UP A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPC)

A VPC is a virtual network that you can define within AWS. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups, and configure route tables. You can also create an Internet gateway and attach it to your VPC so that instances have access to the Internet. For more information, see [Amazon VPC User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).

We would be using the architecture diagram above for this project.
